# movement-expertise-survey
A survey created for research in dance movement expertise. The survey gathers information on multiple genres of physical activities (dance, athletics, martial arts, somatics, kinesiology), roles within these movement practices (teacher, coach, choreographer, audience member) and information on past and current experience with physical activity and observational practices. The survey includes both quantitative and qualitative questions. We are working to streamline the survey to gather essential information in scientific studies examining movement expertise.
